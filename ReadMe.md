# Getting started

This repository contains APIs to interact with RTMaps runtime from external process. Several languages are possible, including C++, Python, Matlab...

We do recommend Python and C++ since these are the most tested and used languages for RTMaps, by far.

For each language you have a dedicated folder containing the source code as well as code samples.
